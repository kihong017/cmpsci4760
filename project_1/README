CMP SCI 4760 Operating Systems - Project 1

The goal of this project is to become familiar with the environment in opsys while practicing system calls.
 This project also requires demonstrating proficiency in the use of perror and getopt in this submission.

The program can be executed with following:
  
  chain [-h] [-i inputfilename] [-o outputfilename]  

  -h                : Shows help message
  -i intputfilename : [Optional] Specifies the input file. If not specified, 'input.dat' will be used
  -o outputfilename : [Optional] Specifies the output file. If not specified, 'output.dat' will be used


Input file Format:

  3              (Total number of loops)
  6              (Number of integer to process on the next line)
  3 6 107 8 1 3  (Integers to process)
  4              (Number of integer to process on the next line)
  1 3 50 4       (Integers to process)
  (Repeat)
  .

  .


How to test the program:

  1.  Go to the directory where logParse.c is located

  2.  Compile using 'make'. This will generate an executable 'logParse'.

  2.1 Can delete the executable using 'make clean'

  3.  Use './logParse' To execute the file using the default filenames

  3.1 Use './logParse -i filename' To execute the file using the specified input file

  3.2 Use './logParse -o filename' To execute the file using the specified output file

  3.3 Use './logParse -i inputname -o outputname' To execute the file using the specified input and output file
