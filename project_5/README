CMP SCI 4760 Operating Systems - Project 5

The goal of this homework is to learn about resource management inside an operating system.

The program can be executed with following:
  
  oss   [-h] [-v]

  -h                 : 	Shows help message
  -v 		  	     : 	[Optional] Turns on the verbose.
 

The program will generate a file called logfile, and oss will write to it.
The file will show when each process was dispatched and was done processing.

How to test the program:

  1.  Go to the directory where oss.c, user_process.c and queue.c are located

  2.  Compile using 'make'. This will generate an executable 'oss' and 'user'.

  2.1 Can delete the executable, object files, and logfiles using 'make clean'

  3.  Use './oss' To execute the file using the default input

  3.1 Use './oss -v' to execute the file that generates more detailed report
  

* I must've done something wrong to handle terminating a process and creating a new one.
* Log file was generated with data. Chart could be little bit off the grid.
