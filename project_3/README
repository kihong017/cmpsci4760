CMP SCI 4760 Operating Systems - Project 3

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with semaphores in Linux.

The program can be executed with following:
  
  chain [-h] [-t Maximum time of process] [Number of slaves]  

  -h                 : 	Shows help message
  -t Maximum time    : 	[Optional] Specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that the program runs.
  					 	If not specified, default is 100 seconds.
  Number of slaves 	 :	[Optional] Specifies the number of slave process. If not specified, 20 will be used.
  						This cannot exceed 20

The program will generate a file called cstest, and all the slave processes will write to it.
Also logfile per slave process will be generated, and will show when each slave process enter and exit critical section.

How to test the program:

  1.  Go to the directory where master.c and slave.c are located

  2.  Compile using 'make'. This will generate an executable 'master' and 'slave'.

  2.1 Can delete the executable, object files, and logfiles using 'make clean'

  3.  Use './master' To execute the file using the default input

  3.1 Use './master -t maximumTime numberOfSlaves' to execute the file using the specified time and number of slaves
