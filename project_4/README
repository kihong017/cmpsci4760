CMP SCI 4760 Operating Systems - Project 4

The goal of this homework is to learn about process scheduling inside an operating system.

The program can be executed with following:
  
  oss   [-h] [-s t] [-l f]

  -h                 : 	Shows help message
  -s Maximum time    : 	[Optional] Specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that the program runs.
  					 	If not specified, default is 100 seconds.
  -l logfile name 	 :	[Optional] Specifies the name of the logfile. If not specified, 'logfile' will be used.

The program will generate a file called logfile, and oss will write to it.
The file will show when each process was dispatched and was done processing.

How to test the program:

  1.  Go to the directory where oss.c, user_process.c and queue.c are located

  2.  Compile using 'make'. This will generate an executable 'oss' and 'user'.

  2.1 Can delete the executable, object files, and logfiles using 'make clean'

  3.  Use './oss' To execute the file using the default input

  3.1 Use './oss -s maximumTime -l logfile name' to execute the file using the specified time and specified logfile name
